Java Coding Guidelines - 75 Recommendations for Reliable and Secure Programs

1. Limit the lifetime of sensitive data.

2. Do not store unencrypted sensitive information on the client side.

3. Provide sensitive mutable classes with unmodifiable wrappers.

4. Ensure that security-sensitive methods are called with validated arguments.

5. Prevent arbitrary file upload.

6. Properly encode or escape output.

7. Prevent code injection.

8. Prevent XPath injection.

9. Prevent LDAP injection.

10. Do not use the clone() method to copy untrusted method parameters.

11. Do not use Object.equals() to compare cryptographic keys.

12. Do not use insecure or weak cryptographic algorithms.

13. Store passwords using a hash function.

14. Ensure that SecureRandom is properly seeded.

15. Do not rely on methods that can be overridden by untrusted code.

16. Avoid granting excess privileges.

17. Minimize privileged code.

18. Do not expose methods that use reduced-security checks to untrusted code.

19. Define custom security permissions for fine-grained security.

20. Create a secure sandbox using a security manager.

21. Do not let untrusted code misuse privileges of callback methods.

22. Minimize the scope of variables.

23. Minimize the scope of the @SuppressWarnings annotation.

24. Minimize the accessibility of classes and their members.

25. Document thread-safety and use annotations where applicable.

26. Always provide feedback about the resulting value of a method.

27. Identify files using multiple file attributes.

28. Do not attach significance to the ordinal associated with an enum.

29. Be aware of numeric promotion behavior.

30. Enable compile-time type checking of variable arity parameter types.

31. Do not apply public final to constants whose value might change in later releases.

32. Avoid cyclic dependencies between packages.

33. Prefer user-defined exceptions over more general exception types.

34. Try to gracefully recover from system errors.

35. Carefully design interfaces before releasing them.

36. Write garbage collectionâ€“friendly code.

37. Do not shadow or obscure identifiers in subscopes.

38. Do not declare more than one variable per declaration.

39. Use meaningful symbolic constants to represent literal values in program logic.

40. Properly encode relationships in constant definitions.

41. Return an empty array or collection instead of a null value for methods that return an array or collection.

42. Use exceptions only for exceptional conditions.

43. Use a try-with-resources statement to safely handle closeable resources.

44. Do not use assertions to verify the absence of runtime errors.

45. Use the same type for the second and third operands in conditional expressions.

46. Do not serialize direct handles to system resources.

47. Prefer using iterators over enumerations.

48. Do not use direct buffers for short-lived, infrequently used objects.

49. Remove short-lived objects from long-lived container objects.

50. Be careful using visually misleading identifiers and literals.

51. Avoid ambiguous overloading of variable arity methods.

52. Avoid in-band error indicators.

53. Do not perform assignments in conditional expressions.

54. Use braces for the body of an 'if','for' or 'while' statement.

55. Do not place a semicolon immediately following an 'if','for' or 'while' condition.

56. Finish every set of statements associated with a case label with a break statement.

57. Avoid inadvertent wrapping of loop counters.

58. Use parentheses for precedence of operation.

59. Do not make assumptions about file creation.

60. Convert integers to floating-point values for floating-point operations.

61. Ensure that the clone() method calls super.clone().

62. Use comments consistently and in a readable fashion.

63. Detect and remove superfluous code and values.

64. Strive for logical completeness.

65. Avoid ambiguous or confusing uses of overloading.

66. Do not assume that declaring a reference volatile guarantees safe publication of the members of the referenced object.

67. Do not assume that the sleep(), yield() or getState() methods provide synchronization semantics.

68. Do not assume that the remainder operator always returns a non-negative result for integral operands.

69. Do not confuse abstract object equality with reference equality.

70. Understand the differences between bitwise and logical operators.

71. Understand how escape characters are interpreted when strings are loaded.

72. Do not use overloaded methods to differentiate between runtime types.

73. Never confuse the immutability of a reference with that of the referenced object.

74. Use the serialization methods writeUnshared() and readUnshared() with care.

75. Do not attempt to help the garbage collector by setting local reference variables to null.
